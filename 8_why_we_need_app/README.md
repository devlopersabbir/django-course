## Introduction:

Today, we are going to talk about why we need Django applications. For those of you who work with the Django framework, you know that Django is a powerful web framework. But sometimes, we think, "Why create separate applications? Can't we just do everything in one project?" Today, we’ll dive into this question and explain why.

## Core Concept:

In Django, an application is a small, organized piece of code that can be easily managed. Imagine you have a big project with features like a blog, user management, and a payment system. If you write all of this together, the code will become messy and complicated. But by using Django apps, we can write each feature separately, keeping the code clean, easy to understand, and easier to modify.

## Advantages:

Each app has its own responsibility. For example, if you only need to modify the blog section, you can just work on the blog app without touching the entire project. This makes maintaining the code much easier. Another great thing is, once you develop an app, you can reuse it in other projects. For instance, if you've built a user authentication system, you can easily add it to future projects as well.

## Conclusion:

So, in summary, using Django applications helps organize the code, makes it reusable, and simplifies maintenance. That’s why it's important to create separate Django apps within a project. I hope you now understand why we need to use apps within a project.
